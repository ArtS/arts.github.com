Hey there! My name is Art Skvira and I am a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. I tell
the machines what to do so you can focus on your business.

### Highlights

them to service a _**growing customer base**_ on an emerging mobile platform, 
increasing the overall appeal of the products and services being offered.
* Helped a client to _**migrate a large database**_ of their existing users to a
newly developed website, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Successfully 
_**minimised the downtime**_ and ensured smooth delivery.
* Delivered a proof-of-concept solution that had confirmed a business case for 
the _**significant reduction of operations costs**_ of my client's call centre.
* Enabled a client to _**attract a large customer base**_ by creating an appealing
set of online profile management/professional networking tools.
* Helped a client to develop a _**mobile solution**_ for its corporate clients,
thus enable them to provide a better service to existing customers as well

### What my clients say

    <p class="mb-0">
    Art has been instrumental in the early days of Scheduleflow. His expertise 
    and hands-on involvement enabled us to iterate rapidly, build and deliver 
    what our target market needed.
    <br/>Art demonstrated his insight into development practices, by implementing 
    streamlined development processes, allowing us to deliver features rapidly 
    and to a very high level of quality. This meant we had dramatically reduced 
    delivery timelines and minimal physical testing.
    <br/>
    Art is one of the most intelligent and broadly skilled senior developer I 
    have worked with. I recommend him whole heartedly and would work with him 
    again in a nano second.

    Art is an extremely talented developer with a passion to do things better. Art was always willing to tackle the 
    problems others would hate. Never scared to refactor the most complex code.
    The quality of his work and attention to detail was a great asset to SEEK during some really challenging and complex projects.
