            <p>ANZ Cash management is an internet banking platform for bank's corporate clients, that 
            simplifies wide range of operations, such as wire transfers, currency trading and payroll management.</p>
            
            <p>I developed a cross-platform app that enabled ANZ to deliver banking functionality to different mobile platforms.
            This helped to increase speed to market by avoiding platform-specific implementations. 
            It also reduced maintenance and deployment costs significantly.</p>

            <p>The app was build using HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript, with aid of Sencha Touch framework.
            Server side was implemented in Java, using Spring, Hibernate, Apache, MySql/Oracle.</p>

            <p>Strong emphasis was put on integration with existing API to enable secure, quick and seamless Internet Banking experience for its users.</p>
