I've been manually tracking the number of .NET/C# jobs in Melbourne for some time now. I could've automated it, probably, but it was easier to do it just by hand - it took only a couple of minutes every day anyway. So I thought it <a title="when you should start automating" href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">wasn't worth it.</a> Although I love automating things like that (sometimes even overly so), I still hesitated.</p>
<p>
But in the recent <a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a> I read about <a href="https://www.google.com/script/start/">Google Apps Script</a> service, and after a quick look at the docs I decided to implement a small tool for job number statistics gathering using Google Apps Script.</p>
<p>
My goal was simple - get a search results page from <a title="Seek" href="http://seek.com.au">seek.com.au</a>, load it as a DOM, run a CSS select to find the element that I need and write the value of that element into a spreadsheet that I use for tracking/analysis.</p>
<p>
Apart from small changes to the original plan (I had to use semicolons, apparently Apps Script hates you for not doing so, throwing random errors at you when debugging; I also decided not to load the whole page as XML, and only load a tiny bit), everything worked amazingly well.</p>
<p>
I must say Apps Script's API is quite comprehensive; API docs are great too - it was quite easy to find the stuff I needed.</p>
<p>
Below is a simple code sample, demonstrating parsing of some HTML:</p>

{% highlight js linenos %}
function getJobsCount() {
    //
    // Download the actual page
    //
    resp = UrlFetchApp.fetch("http://www.seek.com.au/...");
    if (resp.getResponseCode() !== 200) {
    return null;
    }

    //
    // Get contents of an element in HTML
    //
    var xml = Xml.parse(xmlText, true);
    if (xml === null) {
    return null;
    }

    var root = xml.getElement();
    if (root === null) {
    return null;
    }

    // return inner text of HTML element, containing number of jobs
    return root.body.h1.strong.getText();
}

//
// Add a row to the spreadsheet
//
var doc = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/...');
if (doc === null) {
    return;
}
doc.setActiveSheet(doc.getSheetByName('Seek Scraper Test'));

var now = new Date();
var dateStr = [now.getDate(),
               now.getMonth()+1,
               now.getFullYear()].join('.')
            + ' '
            + [now.getHours(),
               now.getMinutes(),
               now.getSeconds()].join(':');

var jobsCount = getJobsCount();

if (jobsCount !== null)
    doc.appendRow([dateStr, jobsCount]);

{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can schedule a recurring execution of your scripts - for example to set certain function to run automatically every hour, on Google's side, without you having to maintain any infrastructure.</p>

<p>Here's a neat example of some data this simple script has collected over a period of time:</p>

<p>Overall, I am quite pleased with the result. Although some people seem to be <a title="Google Apps Script discussion on Hacker News" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5712410">raising concerns</a> about the stability of the platform and API, I think it's great for little tools like this one.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll have to invest a bit more time into error reporting and logging, but overall the platform looks promising.
