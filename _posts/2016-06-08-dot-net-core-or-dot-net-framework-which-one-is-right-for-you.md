.NET Core RC2 has been relesed just recently and while things have somewhat stabilised, there's
still a lot of confusion around the differences between spanking new .NET Core and the older
but more stable .NET Framework.

Sure, Microsoft dudes try to clear things up by shooting videos like this one - '[Episode 420: Nick Landry on .NET Framework and .NET Core][1]',
but there's a lot of noise in those videos and if you're anything like me, you'd rather read a short 
and sweet summary than to spend 20 minutes listening to those guys chit chat.

.NET Framework in its present shape and form with all its varios versions can be confusing, if not
overwhelming. That's why I wrote a short guide into key differences between these two, hope it helps 
to figure out whether you should jump on the bandwagon.
