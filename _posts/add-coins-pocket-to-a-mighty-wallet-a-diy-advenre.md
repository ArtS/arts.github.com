When my old leather wallet started falling apart I decided I could do without another piece of an animal's skin. Turns out in this day and age you don't need to kill a cow to make a wallet - just use something synthetic, like [tyvek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek). 

Quite expectedly there are companies making stuff, including wallets, out of this material. And I almost liked this one - [Wealth of Knowledge Mighty Wallet](http://amzn.to/1qX3LX2). I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't. It was a spiraling downfall after such a promising, spectacular rise. 

No. Coins. Pocket. I kid you not - no place to put my lovely latte coins. 

So I kept searching and found a couple more wallets: [The Slim Wallet](http://www.theslimwallet.com/) and [Mius](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/175193107/ecological-poche-tyvek-cynober-wallet). Both had a coin pocket but first one was way too small (just one pocket for cards and one for notes/receipts). So I got the Mius, which turned out to be rather a rather disappointing experience - credit card pockets were too small, initially I had to force cards into them; the only bills/receipts compartment was small too.

Back to the square one. I ordered a mighty wallet and modified it, [adding a side coins pocket](http://lostswissmiss.com/2014/01/10/mighty-wallet/). It worked initially but then coins started falling out the other end and just got caught up in the internal folds of the wallet. Another disappointment.

When doing that mod I noticed that the back "wall" of the wallet was actually a folded piece. That gave me an idea. What if i just cut a short, straight opening through it and put a velcro "lock"?

That's what happened next.

I unfolded the back of the wallet and cut a small incision from approximately 1cm mark to 9cm mark on the wallet, adding romb-like holes as rip-stops.

That's how wide it is relative to coins size, not too long but not short either.

Then I cut a narrow velcro strap so it's a bit longer than the actual incision.

And glue-slapped the velcro strip inside the wallet, while it was still unfolded.

And voila, a bad-ass wallet with a toight like a toiger coins pocket!
