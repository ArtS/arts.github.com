There probably was only a handful of subjects at school and later at uni that I liked - and I
despised or ignored the rest, doing everything I could just to get a good enough grade to get to the
next term. It wasn't all that different at work after that - whenever something boring had to be
done, I'd distract myself with whatever I could - news reading, social media, pretending to 'learn'
by reading tech articles/books. Sometimes that worked out ok, other times it totally sucked due to
the stress of looming deadlines.

I however managed to notice a few things that affected my personal productivity and that fuzzy
'wellbeing' feeling in both good and bad ways. For example, focusing on a task for some period of
time, even if it wan't terribly exciting at first, helped to get into 'the flow' and continuing
further on was much easier than getting over that initial hump. A day of focused work made me feel
much better both physically and mentally, compared to other days that were occupied by mindless and
jumpy internets browsing.

Recently I started doing an online course on coursera.org, "[Learning How To
Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)", and to my utmost surprise some of the mental
tricks that I discovered the hard way are discussed in the course and apparently have some solid
scientific backing. I'd like to list my favourite ones here - I do hope they'll help you to be more
effective and less frustrated (read - more happy) or maybe even encourage you to take the course.

###Distractions kill attention

It turns out that people do not multitask all that well - there's actually an inverse correlation:
those thinking they are good multitaskers are more likely to be quite bad at it. Multitasking uses
up our mental resources pretty quickly (which in my case makes me feel completely drained of life by
the end of a day), leads to increased rate of errors and can be downright dangerous if lives of
other people depend on your work. Strictly speaking we don't even multitask - i.e. we don't do two
things in parallel, but switch between them.

Researchers at London Institute of Psychiatry found that multitasking dumbs people down more than
smoking a joint of [marijuana][1]. Another study by RAC Foundation, a British nonprofit organisation,
found that people who were texting while in the driving simulator reacted 35% slower when writing a
text message â€” that's [slower than driving drunk or stoned][2].

A [study][3], published in The Journal of Experimental Psychology, found that for all types of
tasks, the participants lost time when they had to switch from one task to another and back again.
It also took significantly longer to switch between the more complicated tasks.

Practically this means you better avoid multitasking and eliminate distractions, such as instant
messaging/notifications of various sorts, new email alerts and SMSes and focus on one solid piece of
work.

There's a very simple, yet surprisingly effective technique for "getting into the groove", called
"Pomodoro" - I briefly described my personal experience in the this blog post - "[Four apps that
changed my messy life for the better][4]". Setting a 25 minutes timer and focusing on a particular
piece of work while avoiding distractions and interruptions feels surprisingly great and most
importantly, it gets stuff done.

###Problem dead end
I always suspected it's hard to solve novel problems by just intently focusing, and almost always
solutions to problems at work or precursors to those solutions popped up in my mind while I was
doing something completely different, like riding a bike or walking. I outlined some strategies that
seem to work for me in a blog post "[When You Are Stuck](/when-you-are-stuck/)".

Now I have a scientific confirmation for this finding - apparently our brains use two distinct modes
of operation: focused and diffused (aka 'default mode network'). When you work on a problem
intently, your focused mode kicks in - your true and tried neural network get engaged - all those
skills and experience you have acquired and honed during countless hours of work or study. It's all
well and great, but these networks will hardly help you in solving problems of new, unknown kind.
That's where the diffuse mode steps in - in that mode our brain restructures learned information and
experiences and connects them in novel, unexpected ways, thus increasing the chances of finding new
types of answers.

Diffuse mode is activated when you are not working on that problem and doing something else -
resting (see [this](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~immordin/papers/Immordino-YangetalRESTISNOTIDLENESSPPS2012.pdf)
and [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235031) articles), exercising or even sleeping. Physical activity seems
to be particularly beneficial for enhancement of cognitive abilities - it helps to
[cope with stress better](http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S37/28/70Q72/index.xml?section=topstories), 
increase [growth of new neurone and their integration into existing networks](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02647.x/abstract;jsessionid=E4134A5195F3AD3E841B52CBD741F937.f01t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false).

###Understanding is the key
I hated statistics at school, but later I found out that you can actually do pretty amazing things
with it. Since then I took a couple of online courses on statistics - some bad, some really good.
What made the good ones to stand apart from the bad ones was the way new learning material was
structured and explained. Everything was broken down to small, digestible bits and supplemented with
easy to remember, sometimes visually striking metaphors.

For example the concept of the average value was presented like a see-saw with weights at different
places.

![mean or average is really a see-saw](/img/lh2l/seesaw.png)

This unexpected, yet easy to grasp image that related to something that I already new and made it
really easy to remember the idea.

Again, there's a strong evidence that we don't remember abstract facts, numbers and ideas all that
well, but when we try to connect new information to something that we already know it becomes much
easier to remember. Our visual cortex - area of the brain that processes visual and spatial
information has remarkable memorisation abilities, that's why "a picture's worth thousand words".
It's much easier to remember something visually striking than just a dull set of numbers or facts.

Another proverb, "morning is wiser than the evening" is something that we now have a scientific
confirmation for - sleep is essential for the [formation and enhancement of new memory](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7723.abstract)

###Meditation
Something that I am yet to find a scientific explanation for is the effects of meditation on
attention. I noticed that my attention span improved dramatically after a few weeks of 30 to 40
minutes per day of mindfulness meditation practice. See my blog post "[You are batshit crazy](/you-are-batshit-crazy/)" for more
details on that. I really wish I started meditating earlier in my life, such a great effect it had.
